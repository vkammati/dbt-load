macros:
  - name: add_hash_key
    description: "Macro which takes a list of columns that make a row unique and returns a hash key(surrogate key) called 'modelname_sk'.
    Column list should be provided by the developer. The macro itself does not look at what makes a row unique.
    This macro needs 'dbt_utils' package as deps because it uses the 'generate_surrogate_key()' function to generate the hash key on it."
